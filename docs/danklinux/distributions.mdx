# Supported Distributions

DankLinux targets a wide range of distributions by embracing native package managers and building from source when necessary. This guide outlines supported platforms, package sources, and special considerations.

## At a Glance

| Family | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arch & derivatives | Fully supported | Uses `pacman` + local AUR builds. |
| Fedora & derivatives | Fully supported | Relies on COPR repositories maintained by the project. |
| Ubuntu 25.04+ | Supported | Compiles several components from source; longer install times. |
| Debian 13+ (Trixie) | Supported (niri only) | Hyprland unavailable; focuses on niri. |
| openSUSE Tumbleweed | Supported | Most packages in repo; builds quickshell/matugen manually. |
| NixOS | Supported via flake | Managed through the DankMaterialShell flake modules. |

## Arch Linux & Derivatives

**Tested on:** Arch, ArchARM, Archcraft, CachyOS, EndeavourOS, Manjaro

- Installer uses `pacman` for official packages and `makepkg` for AUR builds.
- Packages such as `quickshell-git`, `matugen-bin`, and `dgop` are compiled locally.
- NetworkManager is recommended for out-of-the-box integration.
- Existing configs are backed up before Dank presets are applied.

## Fedora, Nobara, Fedora Asahi Remix

- Requires `dnf-plugins-core` to enable COPR repositories.
- DankLinux automatically enables:
  - `avengemedia/danklinux` (quickshell-git, cliphist, ghostty, matugen)
  - `avengemedia/dms` or `avengemedia/dms-git` (DankMaterialShell packages)
  - `yalter/niri` and `solopasha/hyprland` for compositor packages
- SELinux contexts are handled by the RPM scripts.

## Ubuntu 25.04+

- Installs build prerequisites and fetches Go from the `ppa:longsleep/golang-backports` PPA.
- Builds quickshell, matugen, dgop, and niri from source; expect lengthy compilation steps.
- Hyprland is installed via `ppa:cppiber/hyprland`.
- Ideal for users comfortable with compile-time dependencies.

## Debian 13 (Trixie)

- Focuses on niri (Hyprland currently unavailable).
- Builds quickshell, matugen, dgop, and niri locally using the system toolchains.
- Mirrors the Ubuntu workflow but without Hyprland-specific steps.

## openSUSE Tumbleweed

- Uses `zypper` for most dependencies: hyprland, niri, ghostty, wl-clipboard, cliphist, etc.
- Builds quickshell and matugen from source, applying openSUSE-specific compiler flags.
- Works well on rolling releases thanks to up-to-date Wayland stacks.

## NixOS

DankLinux does not manage NixOS directly. Instead, use the [DankMaterialShell flake](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell/tree/master#nixos---via-home-manager):

```nix
imports = [
  inputs.dankMaterialShell.homeModules.dankMaterialShell.default
  inputs.dankMaterialShell.homeModules.dankMaterialShell.niri
];

programs.dankMaterialShell.enable = true;
```

Add `dgop` and the `dms-cli` flake inputs as described in the main README to keep integrations working.

## Unsupported or Experimental Platforms

- **Wayland-only:** The installer assumes a Wayland compositor; X11 environments are not targeted.
- **Older Ubuntu/Debian releases:** Lacking required package versionsâ€”upgrade to the supported versions above.
- **Other Distros:** Contributions are welcome! Follow the manual installation steps in the repository to validate support.

When extending support, update this guide and submit a pull request to document package sources, compilation notes, and caveats.
