# Configuration

DankLinux aims to be minimally intrusive, but power users and maintainers can tailor the installation process, package selection, and runtime behavior. This page outlines the primary levers available after running `dankinstall`.

## Installer Configuration

Most installer choices are made interactively, but you can influence behavior by:

- **Re-running `dankinstall`:** Change compositor presets, reinstall packages, or repair missing dependencies. Previous configs are backed up with timestamped suffixes.
- **Skipping Components:** Decline optional modules (e.g., greeter, clipboard helpers) when prompted to keep the system lean.
- **Custom Package Mirrors:** Configure your distribution’s package manager before running the installer if you need mirrors or caching proxies.

## Manual Binary Builds

When packaging for new distributions or offline environments, build the CLI and supporting binaries manually.

### dms CLI

```bash
# Requires Go 1.24+
make          # builds bin/dms-linux-<arch>
sudo make install

# Distribution-specific build without update/greeter helpers
make dist     # outputs bin/dms-linux-amd64 and bin/dms-linux-arm64
```

### dankinstall

The installer script lives in the `scripts/` directory of the repository. You can modify it to add package mappings or tweak prompts before rebuilding the CLI.

## Manual Package Building

Some distributions require compiling components from source. The repository documents recommended commands:

- **quickshell:** Build with `cmake` and Qt6 development packages (Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE).
- **matugen:** Compile via `cargo install --path .` when binaries are unavailable.
- **dgop:** Use `go build ./...` or `make` in the dgop repo and install the resulting binary.
- **niri:** Build with Rust (`cargo build --release`) on distributions lacking prebuilt packages.

Refer to the [Distribution Setup](/docs/danklinux/distributions) page for exact commands.

## Directory Layout

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/usr/local/bin/dms` | Installed CLI for shell management and IPC. |
| `~/.config/quickshell/dms` | Cloned DankMaterialShell workspace. |
| `~/.config/DankMaterialShell/` | Settings and theme data synced with the shell. |
| `/var/cache/dms-greeter` | Cache directory for the optional greeter. |

## Integrating with System Services

- **systemd User Units:** DankLinux installs user services for `dms` and related helpers. Manage them using `systemctl --user` commands.
- **Greeter:** Configure greetd via `dms greeter install` or edit `/etc/greetd/config.toml` manually. See the [Advanced Configuration](/docs/dankmaterialshell/advanced-configuration) for greeter settings.

## Updating DankLinux

- Pull latest releases from the [DankLinux GitHub](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/danklinux) repo and rebuild the CLI with `make && sudo make install`.
- Re-run `dankinstall` to catch new dependencies or updated configuration defaults.
- Keep track of upstream commits for quickshell, niri, Hyprland, and matugen, especially on distributions using source builds.

## Contributing Configuration Enhancements

- Add new distro support by extending the installer scripts and updating this documentation.
- Share curated compositor presets or additional feature toggles via pull requests.
- Document edge cases discovered in the field to help other users.

DankLinux is designed to grow with the desktop ecosystem—customize responsibly and upstream improvements whenever possible.
