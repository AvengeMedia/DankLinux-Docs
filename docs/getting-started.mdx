# Getting Started

Welcome to Dank Linux! This guide will help you get started with installing and configuring the Dank Linux suite on your system.

## Quick Installation

The fastest way to get started is with our one-line installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.danklinux.com | sh
```

# ! TODO - add dankinstall screneshot

This will:
- Install all dependencies for your distribution
- Set up DankMaterialShell, dgop, dsearch, matugen, and other optional enrichments.
- Configure your chosen compositor (niri or Hyprland)

## Manual Installation

Manual installation is also supported, and simple. See the installation section for each component:
