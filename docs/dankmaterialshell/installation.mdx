# Installation

This guide covers installation of DankMaterialShell across different Linux distributions and methods.

## Dependencies

DankMaterialShell requires:

- **Quickshell** (required) - The core framework
- **dgop** (optional) - System telemetry for resource widgets
- **dsearch** (optional) - Filesystem search engine
- **matugen** (optional) - Material Design color palette generation
- **brightnessctl** (optional) - Display and keyboard backlight control
- **wl-clipboard** + **cliphist** (optional) - Clipboard history
- **cava** (optional) - Audio visualizer widget
- **qt6-multimedia** (optional) - System sound feedback

## Arch & Derivatives

dms is available on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/), it is assumed that you have an aur helper installed such as [paru](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/paru) or [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay).

For the sake of consistency, we will use `paru` in the examples.

### Stable Release

```bash
paru -S dms-shell-bin
```

### Latest Development Build

```bash
paru -S dms-shell-git
```

These packages ship the shell, widgets, and CLI. Pair them with the `niri` or `hyprland` packages from the official repositories for a complete desktop stack.

## Fedora & Derivatives

Enable the COPR repositories managed by the team to install prebuilt packages:

### Stable Release

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable avengemedia/dms
sudo dnf install dms
```

### Latest Development Build

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable avengemedia/dms-git
sudo dnf install dms
```

The COPR repositories also provide companion packages such as `quickshell-git`, `cliphist`, `ghostty`, and other utilities used by the default configuration.

## NixOS

NixOS has its own documentation, see [here](./nixos.mdx) for details.

## All Other Distributions

*Note: this guide doesn't cover compositor installation - as there are many, you need a compatible Wayland compositor for dms such as niri, Hyprland, sway, dwl, etc.*

### 1. Install Essential Dependencies

#### Quickshell

If your distribution does not provide a quickshell package, you'll need to build it from source. Quickshell requires:

**Base dependencies:**
- cmake, qt6base, qt6declarative, qtshadertools, pkg-config, cli11
- Private Qt headers for qt6declarative (and qt6wayland on Qt < 6.10)
- Qt 6.6 or newer

**Key features and their dependencies:**
- **Wayland support** (enabled by default) - qt6wayland, wayland, wayland-protocols
- **Crash reporter** (recommended) - google-breakpad
- **Jemalloc** (recommended for better memory management) - jemalloc
- **System tray** - qt6dbus
- **PAM authentication** - pam

For complete build instructions and feature flags, see the [Quickshell BUILD.md](https://git.outfoxxed.me/quickshell/quickshell/raw/branch/master/BUILD.md).

#### AccountsService

While not strictly required, it is required to persist certain user profile configurations such as profile picture.

It is available in most distributions' repositories as `accountsservice`.

```bash
# Arch + Friends
sudo pacman -S accountsservice
# Fedora + Friends
sudo dnf install accountsservice
# Debian, Ubuntu + Friends
sudo apt install accountsservice
# openSUSE + Friends
sudo zypper install accountsservice
```

### 2. Clone the DMS Frontend (QML)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/quickshell
git clone https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell.git ~/.config/quickshell/dms
```

### 3. Install the DMS Backend (CLI)

*Requires GO 1.24+*

```bash
mkdir ~/repos && cd ~/repos
git clone https://github.com/AvengeMedia/danklinux.git
cd danklinux
make && sudo make install
```

### 4. Install Optional Integrations

Install optional components for full functionality using your distribution's package manager:

- `dgop` - Detailed system metrics and process lists
- `dsearch` - Filesystem search engine
- `matugen` - Material Design color palette generation
- `brightnessctl` - Display backlight and keyboard lighting
- `ddcutil` - i2c monitor backlight control
- `wl-clipboard` + `cliphist` - Clipboard history
- `cava` - Audio visualizer widget
- `qt6-multimedia` - System sound feedback

## Post Install

After completing installation:

1. Launch the shell with `dms run`
2. Use `dms restart` or `dms kill` to manage the session during upgrades
3. Configure your compositor - see the [Keybinds & IPC](keybinds-ipc) guide
4. Customize appearance via [Themes](themes)
5. Extend functionality with [Plugins](plugins)
