# DankMaterialShell

DankMaterialShell (dms) is a modern Wayland desktop shell built with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) and Go. It consolidates the widgets, panels, and background services typically scattered across multiple applications into a cohesive, theme-aware experience optimized for the niri and Hyprland compositors.

## Why DMS?

- **Unified Desktop Stack:** Replaces status bars, launchers, notification daemons, lock screens, and more with a single, coherent system.
- **Dynamic Material Design:** Auto-generates color palettes from your wallpaper or loads bespoke Material Design 3 themes.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Plugin system, IPC, and CLI allow deep customization without patching core files.
- **Compositor Friendly:** Ships ready-made keybindings and layout helpers for niri and Hyprland while remaining Wayland agnostic.

## Feature Highlights

- **DankBar Widgets:** 20+ configurable widgets for media, workspaces, weather, calendar, system stats, and quick settings.
- **Spotlight Launcher:** Fuzzy-search interface with categories, custom triggers, and pinned favorites.
- **Notification Center:** Grouped notifications with toast history and actionable controls.
- **Dock & Control Center:** Manage pinned apps and system toggles from polished pop-outs.
- **Lock Screen & Greeter:** Matching designs powered by Quickshell's `WlSessionLock` with virtual keyboard support.
- **Process Insights:** Deep system metrics via `dgop`, including per-process usage and thermal monitoring.
- **Idle Management:** Fine-grained control of lock, suspend, screen-off, and hibernate actions.
