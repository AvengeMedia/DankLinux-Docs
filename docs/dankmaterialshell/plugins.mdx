# DMS Plugins

DankMaterialShell’s plugin platform lets you extend the desktop with new widgets, launchers, automation rules, and integrations. This overview highlights showcase plugins, walks you through installation, and points to deeper guides for official, community, and developer resources.

## Highlights

| Plugin | Preview | Why you’ll love it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dank Actions** | ![Dank Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AvengeMedia/dms-plugin-registry/master/assets/dank-actions.png) | Create scriptable controls for the DankBar or control center with icons, labels, and schedules. |
| **Dank Hooks** | ![Dank Hooks](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83e89b5b-0636-4b8e-ba29-1fa4d12169a0) | Trigger automations when wallpaper, audio, brightness, or metrics change—great for alerts and theme sync. |
| **Dank Pomodoro Timer** | ![Dank Pomodoro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AvengeMedia/dms-plugin-registry/master/assets/dank-pomodoro.png) | Track focus sessions with rich notifications, dashboards, and bar integration. |

## Getting Started

1. Create the plugin directory (if it does not already exist):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins
   ```
2. Copy or clone plugin folders into that directory.
3. Open **Settings → Plugins** and toggle the modules you want to enable.
4. Restart the shell with `dms restart` if you make changes outside the UI.

> Always review source code before enabling third-party plugins. Plugins run with the same permissions as your desktop session.
