# Troubleshooting

Most issues can be resolved quickly with the logs and tooling that ship alongside DankMaterialShell. This page lists common symptoms, likely causes, and remediation steps.

## Capturing Logs

Run the shell in a foreground terminal to capture verbose output:

```bash
dms kill && dms run
```

For background sessions managed by systemd, follow the journal:

```bash
journalctl --user -fu dms
```

## Common Issues

### Missing Icons or Fonts

- Verify Material Symbols and Inter are installed:
  ```bash
  fc-list | grep MaterialSymbols
  fc-list | grep Inter
  ```
- Re-run the font installation commands listed in the [Installation guide](/docs/dankmaterialshell/installation) and refresh the cache with `fc-cache -fv`.

### Dynamic Theming Not Working

- Confirm `matugen` is installed and available in `PATH`.
- Ensure dynamic theming is enabled in **Settings → Theme & Colors**.
- Check for `~/.config/gtk-3.0/dank-colors.css`—if missing, re-run the installer or toggle the GTK theme option.

### Qt Applications Ignore Colors

- Set `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME` and `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME_QT6` to `gtk3` or `qt6ct` in your compositor config.
- If using `qt6ct`, launch the Qt configuration tool and select the DMS-generated matugen theme.

### Clipboard History Empty

- Ensure `wl-clipboard` and `cliphist` are installed.
- Confirm your compositor starts the monitoring service:
  ```bash
  wl-paste --watch cliphist store &
  ```
- Restart the shell after installing the utilities.

### Volume or Brightness Keys Do Nothing

- Make sure the recommended IPC bindings are present in your compositor config.
- Install `brightnessctl` for backlight control.
- Inspect `dms ipc call audio status` to verify audio devices are detected.

### Calendar Events Missing

- Install `vdirsyncer` and `khal`, then configure them following the instructions in the README.
- Run `vdirsyncer sync` to refresh calendars and restart the shell.

### Greeter Not Matching Theme

- Run `dms-greeter-sync` (Fedora RPM package) or follow the manual ACL steps documented on the [Greeter page](/docs/dankmaterialshell/greeter).

### Shell Fails to Start After Update

- Update the CLI with the latest binary from the [DankLinux releases](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/danklinux/releases).
- Remove stale cache files under `~/.cache/quickshell/dankshell/` and restart.
- Re-run the installer for your distribution to ensure dependencies are met.

## Getting Help

- Search existing issues or file a new report on the [DankMaterialShell GitHub repository](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell/issues).
- Collect logs (`journalctl` output, `dms run` console logs) and include them when reporting problems.
- Join community channels (niri, Hyprland, or DankMaterialShell discussions) for compositor-specific questions.
