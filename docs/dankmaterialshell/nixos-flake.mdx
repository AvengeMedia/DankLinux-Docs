DankMaterialShell can be installed on NixOS either system-wide using the NixOS module or per-user using home-manager. This guide covers both flake-based installation methods.

:::info Native nixpkgs Available
DankMaterialShell is now available in nixpkgs unstable! If you're on NixOS unstable (25.11), see [Installation - NixOS](nixos) for the native nixpkgs installation method which doesn't require flakes.
:::

## Installation Methods

Choose one of the following installation methods based on your needs:

- **NixOS Module**: System-wide installation, ideal for multi-user systems or when you want DMS available to all users
- **Home-Manager Module**: Per-user installation, ideal for single-user setups or when you want user-specific configurations

## Installation

### 1. Add Flake Inputs

First, add the required flake inputs to your `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    dms = {
      url = "github:AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell/stable";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };
}
```

:::tip Using Unstable Version
If you want to use the unstable (-git) version from the master branch, you can use:
```nix
dms.url = "github:AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell";
```
However, be aware that the documentation here may not be updated for the latest changes. You're advised to check the Nix modules source code in the repository directly, and keep in mind that it may not work properly.
:::

### 2. Import the NixOS or home-manager Module

Add the relevant DankMaterialShell module to your configuration imports:

If you're using the NixOS module:

```nix
imports = [
  inputs.dms.nixosModules.dank-material-shell
];
```

Alternatively, if you're using the home-manager module:
```nix
imports = [
  inputs.dms.homeModules.dank-material-shell
];
```

### 3. Enable DankMaterialShell

In your configuration, enable DankMaterialShell:

```nix
programs.dank-material-shell.enable = true;
```

That's it! Rebuild your system (or standalone home-manager configuration) and DankMaterialShell will be installed  with sensible defaults.

## niri Integration

If you're using the niri compositor, the home-manager module provides additional integration options including automatic keybindings and startup configuration.

:::warning
We do not recommend using [niri-flake](https://github.com/sodiboo/niri-flake) at this time unless you are on DankMaterialShell-git because it currently doesn't support includes, which is fundamental for using niri theming synchronization, keybind file generation and other include-based features of DankMaterialShell. However, if you still wish to use it, the instructions below remain available.
Also note that `niri-stable` package from niri-flake is on version `25.08`, while the recommended version for using with DankMaterialShell is the latest `25.11` (available in nixpkgs).
:::

### Prerequisites

If you choose to use [niri-flake](https://github.com/sodiboo/niri-flake) despite the limitations, ensure you have it in your inputs:

```nix
niri = {
  url = "github:sodiboo/niri-flake";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
};
```

Import it in your home-manager configuration:

```nix
imports = [
  inputs.niri.homeModules.niri
];
```

:::tip
If you're using the niri-flake's NixOS module (`inputs.niri.nixosModules.niri`), you don't need to import the home-manager module separately as it's already included.
:::

### Enable niri Module

You can import and use the niri-specific DankMaterialShell module:

```nix
imports = [
  inputs.dms.homeModules.dank-material-shell
  inputs.dms.homeModules.niri
];
```

Enable niri integration features:

```nix
programs.dank-material-shell = {
  enable = true;
  niri = {
    enableKeybinds = true;   # Sets static preset keybinds
    enableSpawn = true;      # Auto-start DMS with niri and cliphist, if enabled
  };
};
```

This will automatically configure preset keybindings for launcher, notifications, settings, and all other DankMaterialShell features.

:::note
You should not use both `systemd.enable` and `niri.enableSpawn` at the same time, as this will make two instances of DankMaterialShell to be spawned at the same time.
:::


### Polkit Agent

If you want to use DankMaterialShell's built-in polkit agent and use the niri-flake's NixOS module, you'll need to disable niri-flake's default polkit agent to avoid conflicts:

```nix
systemd.user.services.niri-flake-polkit.enable = false;
```

## Configuration Options

:::info
The configuration options below work for **both** the NixOS module and the home-manager module. However, note that:
- **NixOS module**: Installs packages system-wide and places quickshell configs in `/etc/xdg/quickshell/dms`
- **Home-manager module**: Additionally supports plugins, default settings, and default session configuration
:::

DankMaterialShell provides numerous configuration options to customize your installation. Here are the main options:

### Feature Toggles

```nix
programs.dank-material-shell = {
  enable = true;

  systemd = {
    enable = true;             # Systemd service for auto-start
    restartIfChanged = true;   # Auto-restart dms.service when dank-material-shell changes
  };

  # Core features
  enableSystemMonitoring = true;     # System monitoring widgets (dgop)
  enableClipboard = true;            # Clipboard history manager
  enableVPN = true;                  # VPN management widget
  enableDynamicTheming = true;       # Wallpaper-based theming (matugen)
  enableAudioWavelength = true;      # Audio visualizer (cava)
  enableCalendarEvents = true;       # Calendar integration (khal)
};
```

### Custom Quickshell Package

:::info Quickshell from Source

The DankMaterialShell flake already uses Quickshell built from source by default, as many features rely on unreleased Quickshell features. No additional configuration is needed.

:::

If you need to override the Quickshell package:

```nix
programs.dank-material-shell = {
  enable = true;
  quickshell.package = pkgs.quickshell; # or your custom package
};
```

### Settings (home-manager only)

You can configure settings using the home-manager module:

```nix
programs.dank-material-shell = {
  enable = true;

  settings = {
    theme = "dark";
    dynamicTheming = true;
    # Add any other settings here
  };

  session = {
    isLightMode = false;
    # Add any other session state settings here
  };

  clipboardSettings = {
    maxHistory = 25;
    maxEntrySize = 5242880;
    autoClearDays = 1;
    clearAtStartup = true;
    disabled = false;
    disableHistory = false;
    disablePersist = true;
  };
};
```

If you change settings in the GUI while managing settings with home-manager, you will get a popup saying that settings are read-only, with an option to copy the new settings. You can then use json2nix on the copied settings to update your home-manager configuration. 

A complete up-to-date list of available settings can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell/refs/heads/master/quickshell/Common/settings/SettingsSpec.js) and similarly for session settings an up-to-date list can be found [here](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell/raw/refs/heads/master/quickshell/Common/settings/SessionSpec.js).


### Plugins

Install DankMaterialShell plugins declaratively:

```nix
programs.dank-material-shell = {
  enable = true;

  managePluginSettings = true;
  plugins = {
    DockerManager = {
      src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
        owner = "LuckShiba";
        repo = "DmsDockerManager";
        rev = "v1.2.0";
        sha256 = "sha256-VoJCaygWnKpv0s0pqTOmzZnPM922qPDMHk4EPcgVnaU=";
      };
    };
    AnotherPlugin = {
      enable = true;
      src = pkgs.another-plugin;
      settings = {
        some-setting = true;
      };
    };
  };
};
```

You can choose whether or not to manage plugin settings with home-manager through the managePluginSettings option. If there are no plugins with settings defined but managePluginSettings = true, a minimal plugin_settings.json is created that enables the plugins. If there are plugin settings defined, managePluginSettings defaults to true and those settings are placed in plugin_settings.json. If there are plugin settings defined and managePluginSettings is set to false, there will be a warning, but plugin_settings.json won't be created.


### Config includes with niri-flake (unstable)

Latest git version has a hack for config includes support under the `programs.dank-material-shell.niri.includes` option set.

:::note
It is not recommended to use both `niri.includes` (which is enabled by default) and `niri.enableKeybinds`, as the latter one is less flexible and may introduce conflicts.
:::

In most cases, it should work out of the box, but configuration options are available.

#### Defaults

```nix
programs.dank-material-shell = {
  enable = true;

  niri.includes = {
    enable = true;             # Enable config includes hack.
    override = true;           # If disabled, DMS settings won't be prioritized over settings defined using niri-flake
    originalFileName = "hm";   # A new name (without extension) for the config file generated by niri-flake.
    filesToInclude = [         # Files under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/niri/dms` to be included into the new config
      "alttab"                 # Please note that niri will throw an error if any of these files are missing.
      "binds"
      "colors"
      "layout"
      "outputs"
      "wpblur"
    ];
  };
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

For a complete list of available options, check the module files in the DankMaterialShell repository:
- **NixOS module**: `distro/nix/nixos.nix`
- **Home-manager module**: `distro/nix/home.nix`
- **niri module**: `distro/nix/niri.nix`
- **Common options**: `distro/nix/options.nix`

## Rebuilding

After making configuration changes, rebuild your system:

```bash
# For home-manager standalone
home-manager switch

# For NixOS with home-manager as a module
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

## Troubleshooting

### DMS doesn't start automatically

Make sure you have either:
- `systemd.enable = true` for systemd-based startup, or
- `niri.enableSpawn = true` for niri-managed startup

### Missing dependencies

Each feature has its own dependency set. If a feature isn't working, ensure the corresponding `enable` option is set to `true`. For example, clipboard history requires `enableClipboard = true` which installs `cliphist` and `wl-clipboard`.

### Custom keybindings conflict with niri defaults

If `niri.enableKeybinds = true` conflicts with your existing niri configuration, you can disable it and manually configure keybindings using the examples in the [Keybinds & IPC](keybinds-ipc) guide.

## Next Steps

- Configure your preferences via [Themes](application-themes)
- Set up compositor keybindings in [Keybinds & IPC](keybinds-ipc)
- Extend functionality with [Plugins](plugins-overview)
