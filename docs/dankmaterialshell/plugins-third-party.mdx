# Third Party

The DankMaterialShell community maintains an ever-growing library of plugins that cover appearance tweaks, monitoring dashboards, productivity tools, and more. Discover them at the official registry and install them directly into your configuration.

## Plugin Registry

- **Website:** [plugins.danklinux.com](https://plugins.danklinux.com/)
- **Source:** [dms-plugin-registry](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/dms-plugin-registry)
- **Automation:** The site rebuilds automatically through the [publish_site workflow](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/dms-plugin-registry/actions/workflows/publish_site.yml) when new plugins are merged.

Each entry includes screenshots, composer compatibility, capability tags, and installation instructions. Categories include Appearance, Monitoring, Utilities, Launchers, and more.

## Installation Steps

1. Browse to the registry and pick a plugin.
2. Clone or copy the repository into `~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/<PluginName>/`.
3. Enable the plugin under **Settings â†’ Plugins**.
4. Review the README for additional dependencies or permissions.

Always audit code from third-party sources before enabling it.

## Managing Community Plugins

- **Updates:** Pull new commits from the plugin repository to get fixes and features.
- **Dependencies:** Install any required binaries (e.g., `wl-copy`, `curl`, `jq`) listed in the README.
- **Conflicts:** Disable or remove unneeded plugins if you observe performance issues; plugins share the shell process.

## Submitting Your Plugin

1. Prepare a README with installation steps, dependencies, screenshots, and compatibility notes.
2. Validate your `plugin.json` against the schema in the main DankMaterialShell repository.
3. Add your plugin metadata to the [dms-plugin-registry](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/dms-plugin-registry) and open a pull request.
4. Once merged, the publishing workflow updates plugins.danklinux.com automatically.

Share your creations with the community and keep the catalog vibrant!
