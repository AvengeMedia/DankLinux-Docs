# First Party

The DankMaterialShell team curates a set of officially supported plugins that expand the desktop while maintaining consistent UX and styling. Each plugin lives in the [dms-plugins](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/dms-plugins) monorepo and can be installed individually.

## Installation

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins
cd ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins
git clone https://github.com/AvengeMedia/dms-plugins tmp
cp -R tmp/DankActions ./
cp -R tmp/DankHooks ./
cp -R tmp/DankPomodoroTimer ./
cp -R tmp/DankBatteryAlerts ./
rm -rf tmp
dms restart
```

> You can also copy specific plugin directories manually if you prefer not to clone the entire repository.
