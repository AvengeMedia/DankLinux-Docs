# dgop

dgop is a lightweight system monitoring tool providing both CLI and REST API interfaces for accessing system resources.

## Overview

dgop provides comprehensive system metrics through an easy-to-use interface. It's designed as a single-binary solution that can operate independently or integrate with DankMaterialShell for enhanced functionality.

### Key Features

- **CLI Interface** with comprehensive commands for:
  - System metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk)
  - Process monitoring with sorting and filtering
  - Hardware information retrieval
  - GPU detection and temperature monitoring

- **REST API Server** with JSON endpoints for programmatic access
- **Real-time Monitoring** with cursor-based sampling
- **Performance Optimized** with configurable options
- **OpenAPI Documentation** available at `/docs` endpoint

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/dgop/releases)

### Arch Linux

```bash
yay -S dgop
# or
paru -S dgop
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvengeMedia/dgop
cd dgop
make
sudo make install
```

## Quick Start

### CLI Usage

```

Monitor processes:

```bash
dgop processes --sort cpu --limit 10
```

Get hardware info:

```bash
dgop hardware
```

### API Server

Start the API server:

```bash
dgop system --json
```

## Technical Requirements

- **OS**: Linux (uses `/proc` and `/sys`)
- **Go**: 1.22+ (for building)
- **Optional**: `nvidia-smi` and `lspci` for GPU functionality
