| `in:` | Directory | `in:Downloads` |
| `size:` | File size | `size:>5MB` |
| `modified:` | Modification date | `modified:yesterday` |
| `name:` | Exact filename | `name:config.json` |

## Configuration

DankSearch settings can be configured through the DMS configuration interface:

### Indexing Settings

- **Indexed Directories**: Choose which directories to include in the index
- **Excluded Patterns**: Set file patterns to ignore during indexing
- **Update Frequency**: Configure how often the index is refreshed
- **Maximum File Size**: Set limits on file sizes to index

### Search Settings

- **Fuzzy Threshold**: Adjust how strict fuzzy matching should be
- **Result Limit**: Set maximum number of search results
- **Search Depth**: Configure how deep to search in directory trees
- **Case Sensitivity**: Toggle case-sensitive search

## Performance

DankSearch is optimized for performance:

- **Incremental Indexing**: Only updates changed files
- **Background Processing**: Indexing happens in the background
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses minimal system resources
- **Fast Startup**: Quick initialization and search response

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Search not returning results:**
- Check if indexing is complete
- Verify directory permissions
- Ensure search terms are not too restrictive

**Slow search performance:**
- Reduce indexed directory scope
- Increase fuzzy threshold
- Check available system resources

**Missing files:**
- Verify files are in indexed directories
- Check excluded patterns settings
- Manually refresh the index

### Manual Index Refresh

To manually refresh the search index:

```bash
dms search refresh
```

### Reset Index

To completely reset the search index:

```bash
dms search reset
```

## Development

DankSearch is built into DankMaterialShell and doesn't require separate installation. For development and customization:

- **Source Code**: Available in the [DankMaterialShell repository](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell)
- **API Documentation**: See the [IPC documentation](/docs/dankmaterialshell/keybinds-ipc) for search-related commands
- **Plugin Development**: Create custom search plugins using the DMS plugin system

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for DankSearch include:

- **Content Search**: Search within file contents, not just filenames
- **Metadata Search**: Search by file metadata (tags, ratings, etc.)
- **Cloud Integration**: Search cloud storage and remote files
- **Advanced Filters**: More sophisticated filtering options
- **Search History**: Persistent search history and saved searches
